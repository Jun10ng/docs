          email address, password, and other information. You must provide complete and accurate information during the
          registration process and will update your information to ensure it remains accurate. You are responsible for
          all activities in your account, regardless of whether undertaken by you, your employees, or a third party
          (including contractors or agents), and we and our affiliates are not responsible for unauthorized access to
          your account.</p>
        <p><strong>2.2 Your Use and Content.</strong> You represent and warrant to us that (a) you have all rights in
          the Content necessary to grant the rights contemplated by this Agreement; and (b) none of the Content violates
          this Agreement, any applicable law or any third party’s intellectual property or other right. You will ensure
          that the Content, and your use of it, complies with this Agreement, including Section 5 (Acceptable Use
          Policy), and any applicable law. You are responsible for properly configuring and using the Cloud Services and
          taking your own steps to maintain appropriate security, protection, backups, and continuity of the Content.
        </p>
        <p><strong>2.3 User and Performance Data.</strong> Pyroscope may store, process, and use data about Customer’s
          use of the Cloud Services, including but not limited to for the purposes of creating usage, statistics, and
          analytics data. Pyroscope may use such data for its own business purposes, including to maintain and improve
          the Cloud Service and other services and products, to monitor and analyse its activities in connection with
          the performance of such services, and to create anonymized statistics for its marketing purposes.</p>
        <p><strong>2.4 Personal Information.</strong> Pyroscope may store, process, and use personal information about
          employees, contractors, and/or individuals associated with Customer, including but not limited to email
          addresses, full names, company name, company roles and titles, phone numbers, and addresses, including but not
          limited to for the purpose of providing the Cloud Services to the Customer and to issue accurate charges for
          the use of the Cloud Services. The personal information stored by Pyroscope may also be used to provide,
          develop, and customize the Cloud Service and to communicate with the Customer. Such communication may include
          direct marketing, market research, or research polls. Pyroscope will use personal information in accordance
          with the Pyroscope Privacy Policy, located at <a aria-label="https://pyroscope.io/privacy" class=""
            href="/privacy">https://pyroscope.io/privacy</a>, which is incorporated herein by this
          reference.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>3. Cloud Services</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.1</strong> Subject to payment of all applicable fees to us, we grant
          you a limited, world-wide, non-exclusive, non-transferable right and license (without right to sublicense) to
          access and use the Cloud Services in accordance with the terms of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.2</strong> Pyroscope will provide the Cloud Services to the Customer
          substantially as set out in this Agreement. The scope of the Cloud Services is not fixed, but may vary
          depending on which Cloud Services the Customer chooses to order from time to time, selected from the Cloud
          Services made available by Pyroscope. Pyroscope will have the right to make changes to the Cloud Services at
          any time.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.3</strong> The Customer may, from time to time, make orders from
          Pyroscope, including automatically by using APIs of the Cloud Services or through the Site. The Customer shall
          be responsible for any orders made under the Customer’s account, whether by the Customer itself, by its
          authorized users, by the Customer’s data systems automatically, or by unauthorized access to or use of your
          account, and Customer shall be responsible for the payment of all fees based on orders made under the
          Customer’s account. No order made by the Customer is valid until accepted by Pyroscope. Pyroscope will be
          deemed to have accepted the order if it supplies the Cloud Services to the Customer. Pyroscope may place
          controls and restrict the Customer’s orders of the Cloud Services at its sole discretion.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.4</strong> We will make commercially reasonable efforts to make the
          Cloud Services available to you. If an outage to you is caused by an apparent failure in the Cloud Services,
          Pyroscope may provide you with free usage credits in recompense, but has no obligations for any compensation
          in such circumstances. Any compensation we do pay will be in the form of Cloud Service usage credits and may
          not be exchanged for cash or other forms of payment. This compensation will be your sole remedy for
          interruptions or other failures in the Cloud Services. In case of a disagreement over the amount of the
          compensation payable to you, Pyroscope’s decision on the issue will be binding and final. Events exempt from
          compensation may include but are not limited to: (a) scheduled interruptions or planned downtime; (b) load
          caused on the systems by client queries or usage; (c) failures or termination of the virtual machines by the
          hosting providers used by Pyroscope to implement the Cloud Services; (d) unavailability caused by errors in
          third party software utilized by Pyroscope to implement the Cloud Services; (e) unavailability due to hostile
          actions by third parties such as denial-of-service attacks; and (f) unavailability due to circumstances beyond
          our reasonable control, including those specified in Section 15.10 (Force Majeure).</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.5</strong> The Cloud Services are not subject to any particular service
          levels or service availability, and are provided to the Customer strictly on an “as is” and “as available”
          basis. Pyroscope makes no representation nor warrants the availability of the Cloud Services at any particular
          time. Any compensation set out in connection with such service availability shall be the Customer’s sole
          remedy and Pyroscope’s sole liability as regards any non-compliance with such service availability, and such
          non-compliance shall not constitute a breach of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.6</strong> Pyroscope will maintain reasonable administrative, physical,
          and technical safeguards for the protection of the security, confidentiality, and integrity of the Content
          that are no less protective than the security standards with which Pyroscope processes and stores its own
          information of a similar type.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.7</strong> Pyroscope may use subcontractors in the performance of its
          obligations and exercise of its rights under this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.8</strong> Pyroscope may make available to Customer certain features,
          technologies, products, software, and services that are not yet generally available, which may be labeled or
          otherwise described as in “preview”, “pre-release”, “early access”, “experimental”, “testing”,
          “pre-production”, “alpha”, or “beta” (each, a <strong>“Beta&nbsp;Offering”</strong>), for the purpose of
          evaluating performance, identifying defects, and obtaining feedback. We have no obligation to release a final
          version of any Beta Offering, nor offer upgrades or migrations between versions of the Beta Offering or
          between a Beta Offering and a generally available version. Notwithstanding anything to the contrary in the
          Agreement, after suspension or termination of Customer’s access to or use of any Beta Offering for any reason,
          Customer may not have any further right to access or use the applicable Beta Offering, and any Content stored
          in or processed by the Beta Offering may be deleted or inaccessible.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">3.9</strong> Pyroscope may provide Support Services for the Cloud
          Service. If Customer does not purchase a different level of Support Services, Pyroscope may provide a “basic”
          or “free” level of Support Services. If you purchase Support Services, we will provide these Support Services
          in accordance with the applicable Support Agreement, currently available at <a
            aria-label="https://pyroscope.io/support-agreement" class=""
            href="/support-agreement">https://pyroscope.io/support-agreement</a>, and which may be
          modified from time to time. By purchasing Support Services, you accept and agree to be bound by the terms of
          the Support Agreement.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>4. Your Obligations</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">4.1</strong> The Customer will be solely responsible for its compliance
          with this Agreement, including any breach of this Agreement by Customer. The Customer must use the Cloud
          Services in accordance with Section 5 (Acceptable Use Policy), and will be solely responsible for ensuring its
          adherence to this policy.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">4.2</strong> The Customer may authorize users to use the Cloud Services
          under the Customer’s account, including for the purposes of accessing the Customer’s Content. The Customer
          must ensure that any users it authorizes to use the Cloud Services under the Customer’s account comply with
          this Agreement at all times, including in accordance with Section 5 (Acceptable Use Policy). The Customer will
          be responsible for any use of the Cloud Services under the Customer’s account and any use by its authorized
          users, including any breach of this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">4.3</strong> The Customer will be responsible for its own devices,
          systems, applications, connections, and software used to access the Cloud Services. The Customer will be
          responsible for the protection of its data communications and data systems, and for the costs for
          communications and other comparable costs related to use of the Cloud Services.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">4.4</strong> The Customer must use commercially reasonable efforts to
          prevent unauthorized access to or use of its account, including ensuring that its authorized users maintain
          their access credentials (e.g., usernames, passwords, multi-factor authentication information, etc.) in a
          responsible manner. The Customer and its authorized users must not disclose their access credentials to any
          unauthorized persons. The Customer must contact us immediately if it believes any unauthorized activity has
          occurred in its account or any of its account information has been lost, compromised, or revealed to a third
          party. The Customer and its authorized users must change their access credentials upon request by Pyroscope.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>5. Acceptable Use Policy</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.1</strong> You must not (a) modify, alter, tamper with, repair, or
          create derivative works of any software included in the Cloud Services; (b) reverse engineer, disassemble, or
          decompile the Cloud Services or apply any other process or procedure to derive the source code of any software
          included in the Cloud Services; (c) use the Cloud Services in connection with any fork or derivative work of
          Pyroscope Software, unless otherwise explicitly authorized by Pyroscope in writing; or (d) resell, sublicense,
          rent, or lease the Cloud Services to any third party, unless otherwise explicitly authorized by Pyroscope in
          writing.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.2</strong> You must not (a) disable, interfere with, or circumvent any
          aspect of the Cloud Services; (b) attempt to disable or circumvent any security mechanisms used by the Cloud
          Services; (c) perform any security penetration tests or security assessment activities, unless otherwise
          explicitly authorized by Pyroscope’s Head of Operations or Information Security in writing; (d) access or use
          the Cloud Services in a way intended to avoid incurring fees or exceeding usage limits or quotas; (e) use the
          Cloud Services, or any interfaces provided with the Cloud Services, to access any other product or service of
          Pyroscope or its subcontractors in a manner that violates their applicable terms of service; (f) use the Cloud
          Services in a way that poses a risk to the Cloud Services or any third party; or (g) interfere with the use of
          the Cloud Services, or the equipment used to provide the Cloud Services, by others.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.3</strong> You must not use the Cloud Services (a) to violate, or
          encourage the violation of, the legal rights (including without limitation Intellectual Property Rights) of
          others; (b) to engage in, promote, or encourage any illegal activity; (c) for any unlawful, invasive,
          infringing, defamatory, offensive, harmful, or fraudulent purpose; (d) to intentionally distribute viruses,
          worms, Trojan horses, corrupted files, hoaxes, or other items of a destructive or deceptive nature; (e) to
          violate security or integrity of any network, computer, communications system, software application, or
          service (such violations to include without limitation unauthorized access, interception of data or traffic,
          or falsification of origin); (f) to make connections to any users, hosts, or networks unless the Customer has
          permission to communicate with them (such network abuses to include without limitation monitoring or crawling,
          denial of service attacks, intentional interference, operating open proxies, open mail relays or open
          recursive domain name servers, or to avoiding system restrictions); (g) to generate, distribute, publish, or
          facilitate unsolicited or unlawful email or other messages, or promotions or other solicitations of any kind;
          or (h) for hazardous or mission-critical circumstances or for uses requiring fail-safe performance, or where
          failure could lead to death, personal injury, or environmental damage, and you further acknowledge that the
          Cloud Services are not designed or intended for such use and Pyroscope bears no responsibility for any harmful
          impact resulting from such use.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.4</strong> You must not submit, store, or process Content in the Cloud
          Services that (a) is illegal, harmful, fraudulent, infringing, offensive, or in violation of privacy rights;
          (b) violates this Agreement, any application law, or any third-party’s Intellectual Property Rights or other
          rights; (c) constitutes protected health information; or (d) entails cardholder or sensitive authentication
          data unless such data is message-level encrypted by you.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.5</strong> You must only use the Cloud Services in accordance with
          applicable laws and government regulations.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.6</strong> Pyroscope and its subcontractors may review the Customer’s
          use of the Cloud Services, including the Content and Customer’s data, to ensure compliance with the acceptable
          use policy, to discontinue any use by the Customer of the Cloud Services, and to remove any non-compliant data
          of the Customer. Pyroscope and its subcontractors may report suspected infringing activities to officials,
          regulators, or other appropriate third parties, including the disclosure of appropriate information regarding
          the Customer.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">5.7</strong> If the Customer becomes aware that its use of the Cloud
          Services does not comply with this Agreement, the Customer must immediately cease its non-compliant use of the
          Cloud Services. The Customer must immediately comply with any requests of Pyroscope relating to the ceasing of
          any non-compliant use of the Cloud Services.</p>
      </div>
      <h2>6. Orders, Fees, and Payment</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong>6.1 Orders Generally.</strong> All Orders are subject to the terms of this Agreement and are not
          binding until accepted by Pyroscope. Orders created by Customer through the Cloud Service are deemed accepted
          when Pyroscope provides access to the service environment selected by Customer. All Orders are non-refundable
          except as expressly provided in this Agreement.</p>
        <p><strong>6.2 Fees and Payment.</strong> The Customer must pay Pyroscope all fees incurred for its usage of the
          Cloud Service and any additional fees specified in Orders. Unless agreed otherwise in a written Order between
          the Parties, Customer’s use of the Cloud Service is subject to the fee schedule specified by the Site. The
          fees will be calculated and billed monthly. If you choose monthly billing by credit card, you authorize a
          recurring monthly charge to your credit card based on our current fee schedule for the Cloud Services and any
          additional fees specified in Orders, and you must pay us the applicable fees and charges using your credit
          card. If paid by credit card, all amounts payable to Pyroscope under this Agreement are due and must be paid
          within one (1) day from the end of a billing cycle by Customer. If we send a separate invoice for payment
          rather than use credit card processing, all amounts payable to Pyroscope under this Agreement are due and must
          be paid within fourteen (14) days from the date of invoice by Customer. All amounts paid are non-refundable.
        </p>
        <p><strong>6.3 Taxes.</strong> All rates and fees are set out without value added tax (VAT) or any other
          applicable sales tax, which may be added to the fees of your monthly bill or invoice in accordance with the
          then-applicable tax laws and regulations, and you must inform us of your correct location to assist with
          determining the appropriate tax. Customer is otherwise responsible for and will pay all applicable customs,
          duties, sales, use, value added, withholding, or other taxes, federal, state or otherwise, however designated,
          which are levied or imposed because of the transactions contemplated by this Agreement, excluding only taxes
          based on Pyroscope’s net income. If Customer is compelled to make a deduction or set-off for any such taxes,
          Customer must pay Pyroscope such additional amounts as necessary to ensure receipt by Pyroscope of the full
          amount Pyroscope would have received but for the deduction.</p>
        <p><strong>6.4 Credit Card Processing.</strong> For Orders that require payment by credit card, Pyroscope uses a
          third-party credit card processing service to process payments. Customer consents to the use of such service
          and to the transfer of Customer’s credit card details (including any personal data contained therein) to such
          third-party processors. Customer agrees to be bound by any separate terms applicable to the processing
          service. Customer’s credit card will be charged fees automatically for Customer’s use of the Cloud Services at
          the end of each billing cycle. Currently, this third-party credit card processing service is Stripe, Inc. (<a
            aria-label="https://stripe.com/" href="https://stripe.com/" target="_blank" class="outboundlink"
            rel="noreferrer noopener">https://stripe.com/</a>); the Customer is familiar and agrees to be bound by any
          third-party terms applicable to the Stripe service.</p>
        <p><strong>6.5 Late Payments.</strong> Late payments may bear interest at the rate of 1.5% per month (or the
          highest rate permitted by law, if less) from the payment due date until paid in full.</p>
        <p><strong>6.6 Changes to Fee Schedules.</strong> We may change the fee schedule for a Cloud Service, including
          by increasing fees or charges, by updating the Site. In the event that we change the fee schedule for the
          Cloud Services, the fees payable by you will increase or decrease in accordance with any such modification
          upon the date specified by the Site. You are deemed to accept the new fee schedule, and be responsible for any
          fees incurred under the new fee schedule, by continuing to use the Cloud Services after the specified date.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h2>7. Suspension and Discontinuation of Service</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">7.1</strong> Pyroscope may suspend the Cloud Services immediately for a
          reasonable period of time in order to perform installation, change, or maintenance work to the Cloud Services,
          including by itself or by the network or hosting providers or others used by Pyroscope to implement the Cloud
          Services.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">7.2</strong> Pyroscope may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer’s
          access to or use of the Cloud Services, or may suspend, limit, terminate, or delete the Content and any
          Customer data and services, including any backups thereof, immediately (a) due to a data security risk to the
          Cloud Service; (b) we reasonably determine that your use of the Cloud Services poses a risk to the Cloud
          Services or to other users of the Cloud Services; (c) we change the way we provide or discontinue any Cloud
          Service; (d) if law or administrative order requires us to do so; (e) if we become aware of or reasonably
          suspect any activities of Customer or its authorized users that infringe on the policies set out in Section 5
          (Acceptable Use Policy); or (f) if we become aware of or reasonably suspect the Cloud Services are used
          contrary to or for a purpose prohibited by this Agreement, applicable laws, or administrative orders.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">7.3</strong> Pyroscope may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer’s
          access to or use of the Cloud Services or Support Services, or may suspend, limit, terminate, or delete the
          Content and any Customer data and services, including any backups thereof, immediately if (a) if the Customer
          does not pay in full the fees due under this Agreement by their due date; (b) Pyroscope has reasonable belief
          that the Customer will not pay in full the fees due under this Agreement by their due date; or (c) the
          Customer does not have a valid payment method associated with its account and is not within the term of a free
          trial. This suspension or limited access may continue until the Customer has paid all fees in full and/or has
          associated a valid payment method with its account. Pyroscope may notify you with warnings before and may
          notify you after it takes any such action.</p>
        <p><strong class="ps-legal__small-pad">7.4</strong> Pyroscope may suspend, limit, or terminate the Customer’s
          access to or use of any Beta Offering, or may suspend, limit, terminate, or delete the Content and any
          Customer data and services associated with any Beta Offering, including any backups thereof, immediately at
          any time and for any reason.</p>

      <h2>10. Confidentiality</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong>10.1 Confidential Information.</strong> Each party shall retain in confidence the Confidential
          Information disclosed or made available by the other party pursuant to this Agreement. For purposes of this
          Agreement, <strong>“Confidential&nbsp;Information”</strong> means any technical or business information
          disclosed by one party to the other party that: (a) if disclosed in writing, is marked “confidential” or
          “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure; (b) if disclosed orally, is identified as “confidential” or
          “proprietary” at the time of such disclosure, and is summarized in writing sent by the disclosing party to the
          receiving party within thirty (30) days after any such disclosure; or (c) under the circumstances, a person
          exercising reasonable business judgment would understand to be confidential or proprietary. Notwithstanding
          any failure to so designate it, the Pyroscope Materials are Pyroscope’s Confidential Information and Content
          is Customer’s Confidential Information.</p>
        <p><strong>10.2 Confidentiality Obligations.</strong> Each party shall (a) maintain the confidentiality of the
          other party’s Confidential Information using at least a reasonable degree of care; (b) refrain from using the
          other party’s Confidential Information except for the purpose of performing its obligations under this
          Agreement; and (c) not disclose Confidential Information to any third party except to employees,
          subcontractors, and agent as is reasonably required in connection with this Agreement and who are subject to
          confidentiality obligations at least as protective as those set forth in this Section 10.</p>
        <p><strong>10.3 Confidentiality Limitations.</strong> The confidentiality obligations will not apply to any
          Confidential Information of the other party which (a) is now or hereafter becomes generally known or available
          to the public, through no act or omission on the part of the receiving party; (b) was known, without
          restriction as to use or disclosure, by the receiving party prior to receiving such information from the
          disclosing party; (c) is rightfully acquired by the receiving party from a third party who has the right to
          disclose it and who provides it without restriction as to use or disclosure; or (d) is independently developed
          by the receiving party without access to any Confidential Information of the disclosing party. The receiving
          party may disclose Confidential Information to the extent required by any law or regulation or by order of a
          court or governmental body of competent jurisdiction, provided that the receiving party uses reasonable
          efforts to give the disclosing party reasonable advance notice of such required disclosure in order to enable
          the disclosing party to prevent or limit such disclosure (<strong>“Permitted Disclosures”</strong>). Pyroscope
          will have no obligation under this Section 10 for any Content or other data that Customer transmits to the
          Cloud Service in breach of Section 5 (Acceptable Use Policy).</p>
        <p><strong>10.4 Other Confidentiality Terms.</strong> Each party shall immediately notify the other party of any
          unauthorized disclosure or use of any Confidential Information and assist the other party in remedying such
          unauthorized use or disclosure by taking such steps as are reasonably requested by such other party. The
          provisions of this Section 10 shall supersede any non-disclosure agreement by and between the Parties (whether
          entered into before, on, or after the Effective Date) that would purport to address the confidentiality and
          security of Content and such agreement shall have no further force or effect with respect to Content.</p>
        <p><strong>10.5 Injunctive Relief.</strong> Any breach or threatened breach of this Section 10 may cause
          irreparable harm to the disclosing party for which there is no adequate remedy at law. Therefore, the
          disclosing party will be entitled to seek injunctive relief without the necessity of proving actual damages or
          posting a bond, in addition to any other remedies available at law.</p>
        <p><strong>10.6 Confidentiality Period.</strong> The rights and obligations related to the Confidential
          Information shall survive the termination of this Agreement for a period of three (3) years from such
          termination.</p>

      <h2>12. Indemnification</h2>
      <div class="ps-legal__indent">
        <p><strong>12.1 Customer Indemnification.</strong> Customer will defend Pyroscope and our affiliates and
          licensors from and against any third-party claim, demand, or lawsuit arising out of or relating to (a) your
          use of the Cloud Services (including any activities under your account and use by your employees and
          personnel) in breach of Section 5 (Acceptable Use Policy); (b) any breach of this Agreement or violation of
          applicable laws, rules, or regulations by you, including in connection with the Cloud Services; or (c) any
          Content or the combination of any Content with other applications, content, services, or processes, including
          any claim involving alleged infringement or misappropriation of Intellectual Property Rights or other
          third-party rights. Customer will pay any damages, costs, losses, and expenses (including reasonable legal
          fees) finally awarded against or associated with Pyroscope that are attributable to any such action, or for
          amounts paid by Pyroscope to settle such action. If we or our affiliates are obligated to respond to a
          third-party subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process, you will also reimburse us for reasonable
          legal fees, as well as our employees’ and contractors’ time and materials spent responding to the third-party
          subpoena or other compulsory legal order or process at our then-current hourly rates.</p>
        <p><strong>12.2 Pyroscope Indemnification.</strong> Pyroscope will defend Customer from and against any
          third-party claim, demand, or lawsuit arising out of the alleged infringement of a third party’s Intellectual
          Property Rights by (a) Pyroscope’s technology used to deliver the Cloud Services, and (b) any Pyroscope
          Software expressly licensed under an Order (together, the <strong>“Pyroscope Technology”</strong>), and
          Pyroscope will pay such damages or costs as are finally awarded against Customer or agreed to in settlement
          attributable to any such action. Pyroscope assumes no liability hereunder for any claim of infringement to the
          extent based on: (a) Content; (b) use of software other than a current, unaltered release of the Pyroscope
          Software, as provided by Pyroscope to Customer; (c) the combination, operation, or use of the Pyroscope
          Technology with equipment, devices, software, services, or data (including without limitation the Content) not
          supplied by Pyroscope, if a claim would not have occurred but for such combination, operation, or use; (d) any
          alteration or modification of the Pyroscope Software or Cloud Services by a party other than Pyroscope; (e)
          open source software; or (f) use of the Pyroscope Technology other than in accordance with the Documentation
          and this Agreement. In addition to Pyroscope’s indemnity obligations, if the Pyroscope Technology becomes, or
          in Pyroscope’s opinion is likely to become, the subject of an infringement claim, Pyroscope may at its sole
          option and expense and as Customer’s sole and exclusive remedy, either: (a) procure for Customer the right to
          use the allegedly infringing element of the Pyroscope Technology, at no charge to Customer; (b) replace or
          modify, in whole or in part, the Pyroscope Technology to make it non-infringing; or (c) terminate the
          applicable Order, and refund a pro rata portion of any fees pre-paid by Customer for the terminated Cloud
          Service. THIS SECTION SETS FORTH Pyroscope’S ENTIRE LIABILITY AND OBLIGATION AND CUSTOMER’S SOLE REMEDY FOR
          ANY CLAIM OF INFRINGEMENT OF ANY INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY RIGHTS.</p>
        <p><strong>12.3 Indemnification Procedures.</strong> Each party will provide the other with prompt notice of any
          claim. The failure of a party seeking indemnification (an<strong>“Indemnitee“</strong>) to provide prompt
          notice to the indemnifying party (an <strong>“Indemnitor”</strong>) relieves the Indemnitor of its obligation
          to defend and indemnify the Indemnitee only to the extent that the failure to provide notice materially harms
          the Indemnitor’s ability to defend the claim. The Indemnitor will have sole control of the defense (including
          selection of counsel) and settlement of the claim, provided any settlement releases Indemnitee from all
          liability. The Indemnitee will provide the Indemnitor, at Indemnitor’s expense, with all assistance,
          information, and authority reasonably required for the defense and settlement of the claim. The Indemnitee
          will preserve and will not waive legal, professional, or any other privilege attaching to any of the records,
          documents, or other information in relation to such claim without prior notification of consent by the
          Indemnitor. The Indemnitee has the right to retain counsel, at the Indemnitee’s expense, to participate in the
          defense or settlement of any claim. The Indemnitor will not be liable for any settlement or compromise that an
          Indemnitee enters into without the Indemnitor’s prior written consent.</p>

          applicable open source license(s) and not this Agreement. Pyroscope makes no warranties, express or implied,
          and will not be obligated under Section 12 (Indemnification) with respect to any Third Party Software. To the
          extent the terms of open source licenses applicable to Third Party Software prohibit any of the restrictions
          in this Agreement, such restrictions will not apply to such Third Party Software. To the extent the terms of
          open source licenses applicable to Third Party Software require Pyroscope to make an offer to provide source
          code or related information in connection with the Third Party Software, such offer is made.</p>
        <p><strong>15.9 Use of Name and Logo.</strong> Pyroscope may identify the Customer as a customer in its
          marketing and sales activities, and may use the Customer’s trade names, services marks, and logos in marketing
          materials, customer lists, press releases, articles, websites, advertisements, or other promotional
          activities.</p>
        <p><strong>15.10 Force Majeure.</strong> You understand and agree that your use of the Cloud Services may be
          delayed or interrupted by causes beyond our reasonable control, and we are not liable for any delay or failure
          to perform any obligation under this Agreement, or any damages or consequences thereof, where the delay or
          failure results from any cause beyond our reasonable control. Such causes beyond our reasonable control
          include without limitation acts of God; acts or orders of government; changes in law or regulations;
          epidemics; flood, fire, earthquakes, storms, or other elements of nature; blockages, embargoes, riots, civil
          unrest, acts of terrorism, or wars; strikes, lockouts, labor disputes, or other industrial disturbances;
          destruction of production facilities; systemic electrical, telecommunications or other utility failures;
          computer, telecommunications, the Internet, Internet service provider, hosting provider, or hosting facility
          failures or delays involving hardware, software, or power systems not within our possession or reasonable
          control; network intrusions or denial of service attacks; or any other cause, whether similar or dissimilar to
          any of the foregoing, that is beyond our reasonable control (individually or collectively as applicable,
          <strong>“Force Majeure“</strong>). A force majeure event suffered by a subcontractor of Pyroscope shall also
          discharge us from liability, if the work to be performed under subcontracting cannot be done or acquired from
          another source without incurring unreasonable costs or significant loss of time.</p>
        <p><strong>15.11 Entire agreement.</strong> This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Parties
          relating to the subject matter of this Agreement. Orders will be for the sole purpose of defining quantities,
          prices, and describing the services to be provided under this Agreement, and Orders are incorporated as a part
          of this Agreement to this extent only; all other terms in Orders are rejected. This Agreement supersedes all
          prior or contemporaneous representations, understandings, proposals, agreements, or communications between you
          and us, whether written or verbal, relating the subject matter of this Agreement. You acknowledge that you
          have not relied on any representations other than those contained in this Agreement. No amendment,
          modification, or waiver of any provision of this Agreement will be effective unless in writing and signed by
          both Parties.</p>
        <p><strong>15.12 Severability; Failure to Enforce.</strong> If any provision of this Agreement is held to be
          invalid or unenforceable, the remaining portions will remain in full force and effect and such provision will
          be enforced to the maximum extent possible so as to effect the intent of the Parties and will be reformed to
          the extent necessary to make such provision valid and enforceable. Our failure to enforce any provision of
          this Agreement will not constitute a present or future waiver of such provision nor limit our right to enforce
          such provision at a later time.</p>
        <p><strong>15.13 Amendments.</strong> We may amend this Agreement at any time by posting a revised version on
          the Site or by otherwise notifying you by email. Amended terms of service become effective upon posting on the
          Site or as stated in our email notice message. By continuing to use the Cloud Services after the effective
          date of any amendment to this Agreement, you agree to be bound by the amended terms of service. Your sole
          remedy should you not agree with the altered Agreement shall be to cease your use of the Cloud Services and to
          comply with your termination obligations outlined in Section 14. Please check the Site regularly. We last
          amended this Agreement on the date listed at the beginning of this Agreement.</p>
